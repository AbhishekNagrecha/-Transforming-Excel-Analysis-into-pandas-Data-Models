# Excel-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
I have used multiple xlsx and csv files to perform general data analysis using python.In (1) I Used libraries like Pandas,NumPy,NumPy financial to perform various types of data manipulations and even interact with external web pages.
In (2) did some general Plotting, used matplotlib and also explored the usage of Pivot Tables.
In (3) used the general Excel formulas and briefly looked into linear regression and in (4) used SequenceMatcher to find similarity betwwn various words.
Will be adding multiple files in the near future..
